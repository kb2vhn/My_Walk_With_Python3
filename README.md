# My_Walk_With_Python3
This is for me to see how I grow while I learn Python.

I work mostly with C# at work for software development. I don't mind the language.


I am a fan of FreeBSD and run this on my home server with many different Jails.
I am wanting to further my programming abilities in a different language that will help me with my passion for ethical hacking. Donâ€™t get me wrong I could do this on a Windows platform or with .Net Core but I think Python will help me best do this form any of the systems that I will use. 

I plan to work through some different tutorials and if this can help others out that would be a major plus.
